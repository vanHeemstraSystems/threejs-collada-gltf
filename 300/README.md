# 300 - Building Our Application

- We set out to build a (Lego) model in [MecaBricks](https://www.mecabricks.com/).

- We'll export the (Lego) model as a Collada (```*.dae```) file from MecaBricks.

- We'll convert the Collada (```*.dae```) file by means of glTF.

- We then load the glTF file into ThreeJS.
